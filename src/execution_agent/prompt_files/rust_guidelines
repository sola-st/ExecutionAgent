## General Guidelines:
**General Guidelines for Rust Projects**

1. **Read the README**
   Start by reading the project's README file on GitHub. It often contains important instructions for installation, usage, and any project-specific details.

2. **Check Dependencies**
   Look for dependencies listed in the README or in the `Cargo.toml` file. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed to manage these dependencies.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following command to build the project and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Build the Project**
   Use Cargo to build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
   Use `--release` for optimized builds, or omit it for debug builds with faster compilation.

5. **Configuration**
   Check if the project requires any configuration files (e.g., `.env` files, TOML configuration files) and set them up accordingly.

6. **Run Tests (if available)**
   If the project provides tests, run them to ensure everything is working correctly:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

7. **Run the Project**
   Follow the instructions in the README to run the project. Common commands include:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   ./target/release/binary_name
   ```

8. **Troubleshooting**
   If you encounter any issues during installation or while running the project, refer to the project's issue tracker on GitHub or search for similar issues others may have encountered.

9. **Code Linting and Formatting**
   Use Clippy for linting and rustfmt for formatting:
   ```bash
   cargo clippy
   cargo fmt
   ```

10. **Test Suite Results**
   When running a test suite, it is normal for some test cases to fail. If the percentage of failing test cases is less than 20% of the total number, it is considered acceptable, and further investigation is not necessary.
