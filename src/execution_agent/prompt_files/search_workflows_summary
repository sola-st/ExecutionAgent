CONTEXT - THE OVERALL GOAL:
We are building an automated system to INSTALL SOFTWARE PROJECTS FROM SOURCE CODE AND RUN THEIR TEST SUITES inside fresh Linux (Ubuntu) Docker containers.

YOUR TASK:
Analyze ALL the provided evidence (web pages, Dockerfiles, requirement files, CI/CD workflows, and README) for the project: {}. Create a CONCISE, STRUCTURED summary that guides an LLM agent through setting up and testing this project.

OUTPUT FORMAT - Use these exact sections:

================================================================================
## 1. CRITICAL RULES (Always include these)
================================================================================
- DO NOT use '|| exit 0' in terminal commands. Only use it in Dockerfile RUN instructions.
- DO NOT use docker commands in the terminal (e.g., "docker build", "docker run"). Write the Dockerfile to a file and the system handles building/running automatically.
- Always install git SEPARATELY in the Dockerfile (on its own apt-get line) to prevent failures if other packages fail.

## 2. DOCKERFILE TEMPLATE
================================================================================
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:24.04

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
ENV TZ=Europe/Berlin

# Install git separately first
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git

# Install other system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    tzdata bash ca-certificates \
    [ADD PROJECT-SPECIFIC PACKAGES HERE] \
    && ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app

ARG REPO_URL
ARG PROJECT_DIR=project

RUN test -n "$REPO_URL" && git clone --depth 1 "$REPO_URL" "$PROJECT_DIR"

WORKDIR /app/${{PROJECT_DIR}}

CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

## 3. SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES (apt-get packages)
================================================================================
List all system packages that need to be installed via apt-get.
Format: package_name - brief reason why needed (if known)

[Extract from evidence: CI workflows, Dockerfiles, README install sections]

## 4. LANGUAGE RUNTIME & VERSION
================================================================================
- Language: [e.g., Python 3.11, Node.js 18, Java 17, Rust stable]
- How to install: [exact commands or package names]

[Extract version requirements from: .python-version, .nvmrc, pyproject.toml, CI matrix, etc.]

## 5. PROJECT DEPENDENCIES (language-specific)
================================================================================
List the commands to install project dependencies.
- Primary method: [e.g., pip install -e ., npm install, cargo build]
- Alternative methods: [if any]

[Extract from: requirements.txt, package.json, Cargo.toml, setup.py, CI workflows]

## 6. BUILD/SETUP STEPS
================================================================================
List the exact commands in order:
1. [first command]
2. [second command]
...

[Extract from: CI workflows, README, Makefile]

## 7. TEST EXECUTION (MOST IMPORTANT)
================================================================================
Primary test command: [exact command]
Alternative test commands: [if any]

To run a subset of tests (for quick verification):
- [command for running specific tests]

Environment variables needed for tests:
- VAR_NAME=value - reason

[THIS IS THE PRIMARY GOAL - Extract from: CI workflows, README test sections, pytest.ini, package.json scripts]

## 8. POTENTIAL ISSUES & ALTERNATIVES
================================================================================
- Issue: [potential problem]
  Solution: [how to fix]

- If X doesn't work, try Y because [reason]

[Extract from: CI workflow workarounds, README troubleshooting, common issues mentioned]

================================================================================
## DISCLAIMER
================================================================================
NOTE: This information is gathered from multiple sources (web pages, repository files, CI configurations) and may be:
- Incomplete or outdated
- Specific to certain OS versions or configurations
- Based on assumptions not documented

The agent should:
1. Use this as a starting point, not absolute truth
2. Install additional packages/dependencies based on error feedback during execution
3. Check error messages and adapt the approach accordingly
4. The list of dependencies above may NOT be exhaustive - be prepared to install more as needed

================================================================================

EVIDENCE ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- Prioritize information from CI/CD workflows (most reliable for automated builds)
- Cross-reference README instructions with actual workflow files
- Extract EXACT commands - don't paraphrase shell commands
- Note any version-specific requirements or conflicts
- If multiple approaches exist, list all with pros/cons
- Be concise but include all actionable information
