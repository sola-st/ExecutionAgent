## General Guidelines:
**General Guidelines for Java Projects**

1. **Read the README**  
   Start by reading the project's README file on GitHub. It often contains important instructions for installation, usage, and any project-specific details.  

2. **Check Dependencies**  
   Look for any dependencies listed in the README or in configuration files like `pom.xml` (for Maven) or `build.gradle` (for Gradle). Ensure you have the required JDK version installed.  

3. **Build Tool**  
   Identify which build tool the project is using: Maven or Gradle. This information should be available in the README or through project configuration files (`pom.xml` for Maven, `build.gradle` for Gradle).  

4. **Build the Project**  
   Use the appropriate commands based on the build tool:  
   - For Maven:  
     ```  
     mvn clean install  
     ```  
   - For Gradle:  
     ```  
     gradle build  
     ```  

5. **Configuration**  
   Check if the project requires any configuration files (e.g., property files, YAML files) and set them up accordingly.  

6. **Run Tests (if available)**  
   If the project provides tests, it’s a good idea to run them to ensure everything is working correctly.  

7. **Run the Project**  
   Follow the instructions in the README to run the project. This could involve running a specific class, starting a server, or executing a specific command.  

8. **Troubleshooting**  
   If you encounter any issues during installation or while running the project, refer to the project’s issue tracker on GitHub or search for similar issues others may have encountered.  

9. **Test Suite Results**  
   When running a test suite, it is normal for some test cases to fail. If the percentage of failing test cases is less than 20% of the total number, it is considered acceptable, and further investigation is usually not necessary.
