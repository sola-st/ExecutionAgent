Do not use the COPY command to transfer files from the host to the Docker image.\n- The script should enable pulling a Docker image, cloning the target repository inside it, installing dependencies, and running the project. Use 'write_to_file'.\nExample template of Dockerfile:\n```  FROM python:3.10-slim  # Adjust the base image based on the project's language and dependencies\n\n  # Avoid interruptive messages from tzdata\n  ENV TZ=Europe/Berlin\n  RUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime && echo $TZ > /etc/timezone\n\n  # Install git, gcc, bash, and other necessary build tools\n  RUN apt-get update && \\\n      apt-get install -y git gcc bash && \\\n      apt-get clean && \\\n      rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* || exit 0\n\n  WORKDIR /app\n\n  # Clone the repository\n  RUN git clone project_git_url || exit 0\n\n  WORKDIR /app/project_name\n\n  CMD [\"bash\"]```\n\n- Notice how '|| exit 0' is added to some steps to avoid build failures in case of errors; you should do this when necessary.\n- Once the Dockerfile is created, an automatic attempt to execute it and create the image will start. You will receive a message about the success or failure of creating the Docker image.\n- If the Docker image is created successfully, all subsequent commands will be executed within the Docker container automatically.\n- Avoid including build and test steps as part of the Dockerfile to reduce errors during image creation.",
